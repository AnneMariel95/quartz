ðŸ“Š Just streamlined my finance manager app's database seeding process with a purpose-built data.sql file for efficient clearing and seeding. ðŸš€  
  
Now, see photo and take a peek at the analytics after two weeks into development (where wallet is still the only feature available on the frontend ðŸ˜† ).  
  
Try the app at https://l.anne-mariel.com/finance-manager
  
Feature coming up this week: CRUD for both categories (income and expense ) and transactions (Food, Transpo, etc.)
