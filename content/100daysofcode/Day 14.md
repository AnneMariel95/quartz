ðŸ’» ðŸ”’ The login to my finance manager app using Google is now functional, and the app is secured. Users have visibility and access only to their own data (wallets for now). It took me a long time to setup this "new" backend, because I wanted configure the schema to support scalable features (TBA!).

Note: In the login page, I disabled username and password because I'm still figuring out how to fix an issue on Post User Registration Action Flow on [Auth0 by Okta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/auth0/).
