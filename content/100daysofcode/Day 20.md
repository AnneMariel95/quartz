Code Hard, Play Hard. Day 20 of #100DaysOfCode
  
Are you someone who likes to jot down notes for future you and wonders how to efficiently share them to other people? With the help of [Obsidian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/obsidianmd/) and #Quartz, I have set up a digital garden, a space to publish my public notes FOR FREE.

See you all soon!
