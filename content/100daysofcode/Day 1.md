ðŸš€ Day 1/100. Thrilled to share I have started another round of #100DaysOfCode! On the first day, I have added tasks and features to implement for my finance manager app to my project board as well as deployed my frontend. Keen to track my progress? Feel free to follow along at this link: https://anne-mariel.com/ 
  
Wondering where the idea started? It was during the 1-day hackathon at my company.
