🎉 Celebrating One Month of Asenso! Thank you for the support, and the 169 visits from 12 different countries that we have so far!  
  
✔ Today, we've made significant progress in getting transactions from start date until end date of each month. This is to understand our spending habits better, and find opportunities for improvement.  
✔ I would also like to inform everyone who has tried out our app so far that I will be seeding the database to require a date input when adding transactions (and don't worry, I'll handle this more effectively next time with a migration 😁 ). Trust me, this adjustment is going to lead to more accurate insights in the future.
