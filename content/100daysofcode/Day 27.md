Just wrapped up an energizing game of badminton 🏸 , and now, I'm excited to share our app has officially been named Asenso!  
  
Asenso is a Filipino 🇵🇭 word that translates to rise or progress. It conveys advancement, improvement, or the act of moving upward in various aspects of life. In Spanish, ascenso also signifies elevation. Whether in Filipino or Spanish, it aligns well with the purpose of a finance manager app designed to help individuals manage their finances and achieve financial progress.
