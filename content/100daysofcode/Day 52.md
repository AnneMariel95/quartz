Day 52 of #100DaysOfCode
  
✅ Update on https://l.anne-mariel.com/finance-manager :  
I mentioned yesterday users can already edit non-default categories. Today I have set a condition in the FE to remove the update button from the default categories.  
  
✅ Main goal for the day:  
I have done some practice on creating APIs using the new [NextJs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextjs/) App Router.
