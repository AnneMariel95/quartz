Day 33. Balancing coding ðŸ’» and life ðŸŽ‰  
  
Worked early on a Saturday on my finance manager app so I can take the rest of the day to celebrate my friend's birthday. ðŸŽ‚ Here's what I've accomplished:  
  
âœ… Added a logout button. Thanks to [Auth0 by Okta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/auth0/) for making it easy!  
âœ… Installed [LottieFiles](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lottiefiles/) library to add animations to my app  
âœ… Added a logo too which I should have done very early in the development  
âœ… Updated project board to add more issues  
âœ… Added this next config to allow images from the [s.gravatar.com](http://s.gravatar.com/) domain: { hostname: "[s.gravatar.com](http://s.gravatar.com/)" }
