🚀 Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode Update! 🚀  
  
Exciting progress! 🌐 The backend has been successfully deployed on Azure. I've set up a resource group, service plan, and web app to ensure a smooth process. I made sure to safeguard all the secrets. 🔒 Today, I have documented each step comprehensively, providing a valuable reference.  
  
Stay tuned for more updates! I'll be diving into the frontend soon to breathe life into this project so it's not just for my eyes in Postman! 😄 Keep an eye out at: https://anne-mariel.com/ 👀  
  
On a side note, while I've been focusing on updates about my personal project, I tackled an interesting challenge at work today. I delved into creating a PDF sharing feature hosted in Blob Storage. The real hurdle? Retaining styling during the cloud storage process. 💻✨
