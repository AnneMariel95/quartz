Day 18. Finance Manager App Update ✏ :  
  
👨 👩 User's Perspective: Imagine wanting to do some editing in a category like "Pet Stuff" from the "Expense" page. You want to edit "Pet Stuff" to "Pet Food". Hit submit, and poof it's been updated! On the other hand, that does not apply to "Food" which happens to be a pre defined category.  
  
💻 Developer's Perspective: In the backend, with this kind of model, there will be a check if a category is pre defined or default. If it is, the edit should not be permitted.
