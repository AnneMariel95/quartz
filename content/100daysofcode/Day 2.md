ðŸ’»ðŸš€ Day 2 of my #100DaysOfCode journey: I started working on the backend by creating an entity, ensuring smooth communication with my Postgres database that I have deployed in Azure.  
  
I will be working on frontend development soon, and I am excited to showcase the progress at https://anne-mariel.com/
