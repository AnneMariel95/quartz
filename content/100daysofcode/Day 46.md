Day 46 of #100DaysOfCode
  
Update on Asenso:  
Yesterday I missed changing the Insights Icon on the Sidebar into a light bulb so I've done that today. 😅 🏸 I have also added a temporary [LottieFiles](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lottiefiles/) animation into our Insights page. Temporary because I believe this still has a lot of room for improvements.
