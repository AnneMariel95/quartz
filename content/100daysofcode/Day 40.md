ðŸš€ Day 40 of #100DaysOfCode. This day was dedicated to revisiting [React](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reactofficial/) and [Node.js](https://www.linkedin.com/company/node-js/) using [NextJs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nextjs/). Special mention to [AITable.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aitable/), your API Table was of great assistance into today's exercise especially when creating proxy backend including database.
